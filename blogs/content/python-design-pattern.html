    <em>Favor object composition over class inheritance.</em>

<p>As a researcher with a background in machine learning and robotics.
    Most of my time and effort have been focused on optimizing the <b>benchmark performance</b> of an algorithm
    for a specific problem for the sake of publishing a paper. 
    It is a shame that despite that I have been using Python for my research projects for a long time,
    I never really learn the design pattern for Python. This blog is a record of my learning journey.
</p>

<p>
    According to the talk by <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brandon Rhodes</a>,
    there are three stages of everyone's programming journey.
    <ol>
        <li>Procedural -- All code in main()</li>
        <li>Abstraction -- Functions</li>
        <li>Encapsulation -- Classes</li>
    </ol>
    For machine learning researchers, it is totally fine to just stay in the first stage, where you could implement 
    all you code in main() with some level of abstraction using functions and classes. 
    You can still achieve great results. However, the most interesting part of programming is the third stage -- Encapsulation.
    It is the stage where you start to think about the <b>Design</b>.

<h2>ðŸ“Œ Definition</h2>
Let's begin with the definition of design pattern.
<div class="note">
    <strong>Design Pattern:</strong> 
    A design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.
    It is a description of a problem that occurs frequently in software design, and a solution to that problem.
</div>

<h2>ðŸ“Œ The Catalog of Design Patterns</h2>
According to the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a>,
there are 23 design patterns in total. However, the book was published in 1994, and some of the patterns are not very useful in modern software development,
especially for python language. According to Brandon Rhodes and his talk 
on <a href="https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/slides/2022-11-codedive/slides.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Classical Design Patterns: Where Are They Now?</a>, 
most of us have been fooled. In his talk, he made the following conclusion:

<ul>
    <li>6 patterns: useless if you have 1st class functions</li>
    <li>3 patterns: are anti-patterns that obscure our data</li>
    <li>4 patterns: decompose big classes, but are obscure</li>
    <li>1 pattern: ambitious but fatally limited</li>
    <li>2 patterns: language built-ins</li>
    <li><b>3 patterns: small but useful</b></li>
    <li><b>4 patterns: huge and dominate our frameworks</b></li>
</ul>


<h2>ðŸ“Œ Four Huge and Dominate  Patterns in Our Frameworks</h2>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Composite:</strong> 
    Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
</div>

<strong>Structure</strong>
    <li><strong>Component</strong> â€“ defines common operations.</li>
    <li><strong>Leaf</strong> â€“ basic object with real behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>Composite</strong> â€“ container that holds children and delegates operations.</li>

<p><strong>Python example:</strong> a simple filesystem tree where folders contain files or other folders.</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class Component:
    def render(self, indent=0):
        raise NotImplementedError

class File(Component):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def render(self, indent=0):
        print(" " * indent + f"- {self.name}")

class Folder(Component):
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.children = []

    def add(self, *components):
        self.children.extend(components)
        return self

    def render(self, indent=0):
        print(" " * indent + f"+ {self.name}/")
        for c in self.children:
            c.render(indent + 2)

# Build a small tree
root = Folder("project")
src = Folder("src").add(File("main.py"), File("utils.py"))
assets = Folder("assets").add(File("logo.png"))
root.add(src, assets, File("README.md"))
root.render()
</code></pre>

<p>Clients call <code>render()</code> without caring whether an object is a <em>File</em> (leaf) or <em>Folder</em> (composite). The composite delegates the work to its children.</p>


<div class="note">
    <strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> 
    Avoid coupling the sender of a request to itsreceiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving
    objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
</div>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Command:</strong> 
    Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable
    operations.
</div>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Interpreter:</strong> 
    Given a language, define a represention for its grammar along with
an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.
</div>

        <th>Category</th>
        <th>Design Patterns</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="5"><strong>Creational</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Singleton:</strong> Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Factory Method:</strong> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Abstract Factory:</strong> Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Builder:</strong> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Prototype:</strong> Create new objects by cloning existing objects.</td></tr>
  
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="7"><strong>Structural</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Adapter:</strong> Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Bridge:</strong> Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Composite:</strong> Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Decorator:</strong> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Facade:</strong> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Flyweight:</strong> Flyweight is a structural design pattern that provides ways to decrease object count thus reducing memory usage by sharing object instances.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Proxy:</strong> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.</td></tr>
  
      <tr>
        <td rowspan="11"><strong>Behavioral</strong></td>
        <td><strong>Chain of Responsibility:</strong> Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Command:</strong> Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, and support undoable operations.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Interpreter:</strong> Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Iterator:</strong> Provide a way to access the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Mediator:</strong> Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Memento:</strong> Capture and restore an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Observer:</strong> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>State:</strong> Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Strategy:</strong> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Template Method:</strong> Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.</td></tr>
      <tr><td><strong>Visitor:</strong> Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.</td></tr>
