                  <h3>Childhood: Rice, Salted Vegetables, and Books</h3>
                  <p>
                    <img src="images/about/home.jpg" alt="Childhood Village" class="inline-text-image">

                    I was born in the Year of the Monkey. Unlike the Monkey
                    King, Sun Wukong, who sprang from a stone egg, I was born
                    in a small mud house in a quiet village in southern China.
                    The village was surrounded by small mountains and rivers,
                    and all villagers were farmers—including my
                    parents. They worked in the fields, growing rice and vegetables.

                    I was the second child in the family. Just like my sister, I attended the local village school. Our
                    teachers traveled from other towns or villages and stayed at the school during
                    the week, returning home on weekends. They, too, were farmers, but they taught
                    us how to read and write. I was the top student in my class.

                    The village school only had four grades. After finishing the fourth grade, I
                    continued my education in a nearby town. At the age of ten, my friends
                    and I would walk to school every Sunday afternoon and return home on Friday. We
                    stayed in the school dormitory during the week, but no food was provided. Each
                    of us carried a bag of rice and a can of salted vegetables—sometimes a little
                    meat. The principal’s wife cooked the rice for us, and sometimes we shared our
                    food with one another.

                    The dormitory was simple, with only two rooms—one for boys and one for girls.
                    The school provided only bed frames, so we had to bring our own bedding,
                    mosquito nets, and pillows. We also carried a small wooden box, which held
                    everything we needed—clothes, a toothbrush, books, and food.

                    I was no longer the top student in my class, but I discovered something new: I
                    learned to play ping-pong.

                    It was the time of China’s economic reform and opening-up policy. My parents
                    left the village and moved to the city for work, while I stayed behind with my
                    grandparents. With money coming from my parents, I became the richest kid in
                    the village.

                    <br>
                    Summer was the happiest time for me. With cows grazing in the valley, all we
                    had to do was keep an eye on them. I spent most of my time in the river,
                    catching fish and swimming under the sun.

                    Middle school felt much like elementary school—similar
                    school life, but more new friends and different teachers. I
                    stated learning English, but I struggled a lot learning how
                    to pronunce the word "trousers".

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I was the only one in my village who made it to high
                    school that year. I had one mission: to spend three years preparing
                    for the GaoKao, the University Entrance Exam. The
                    competition was real.

                    After my GaoKao, I took a job at a local factory while waiting for the
                    results. Then, on the day the scores were released, a friend called me with the
                    news while I was making souvenir products. I had made it. I could go to college—a good one.

                    I did my Master's in Germany. Meanwhile, I was working part-time at a software company
                    and the university. I did my thesis on developing new reinforcement learning algorithms
                    for robot control. After graduation, I moved to Switzerland to pursue my PhD. Most of my
                    colleagues were top students from ETH. They have very sharp skills and mind, like the Swiss
                    knives. I learned a lot from them. I did my PhD on learning robot control based optimal control
                    and machine learning. "The work of Yunlong is stellar", said by Prof. Marco Hutter, ETH Zurich.
                    After my PhD, I moved to the USA to work as Research Scientist on developing new algorithms
                    for general-purpose robot control.

                    They say, "Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better." I tried so
                    many times, yet I failed so many times. I kept trying and learning. I am grateful for all the people who have
                    helped me along the way. Education was my key to the world. It opened many doors for me. I also understand
                    how hard it is to get a good eduction and how difficult it is to maintain continuous learning.
                    I hope I could help more people.
