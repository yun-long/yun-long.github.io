            <p>
              I am passionate about developing algorithms for robots that can learn to perform complex tasks in the real world.
              Here are some of the projects I have worked on:

                            Learning pixel-to-action control policies is challenging due to the high-dimensional
                            and partially observable nature of the problem. This work
                            combines deep learning with first-principle
                            physics through differentiable simulation to
                            enable autonomous navigation of multiple
                            aerial robots through complex environments at
                            high speed. Our approach optimizes a neural
                            network control policy directly by
                            backpropagating loss gradients through the
                            robot simulation using a simple point-mass
                            physics model and a depth rendering engine.
                            Despite this simplicity, our method excels in
                            challenging tasks for both multi-agent and
                            single-agent applications with zero-shot
                            sim-to-real transfer. In multi-agent
                            scenarios, our system demonstrates
                            self-organized behavior, enabling autonomous
                            coordination without communication or
                            centralized planning - an achievement not
                            seen in existing traditional or
                            learning-based methods. In real-world forest
                            environments, it navigates at speeds up to 20
                            m/s. All these capabilities are deployed on a
                            budget-friendly $21 computer, costing less
                            than 5% of a GPU-equipped board used in
                            existing systems.

                              This project presents one of the
                              first successful applications of differentiable
                              simulation for real-world quadruped locomotion,
                              offering a compelling alternative to traditional
                              RL methods. Differentiable simulation promises
                              fast convergence and stable training by computing
                              low-variance first-order gradients using robot
                              dynamics. However, its usage for legged robots is
                              still limited to simulation. The main challenge
                              lies in the complex optimization landscape of
                              robotic tasks due to discontinuous dynamics. This
                              work proposes a new differentiable simulation
                              framework to overcome these challenges.

                            How can we push a robot to its absolut limits in the physical world?
                            We developed one of the world fastest autonomous drone and pushed this machine to its maximum performance
                            in the real world, achieving a peak acceleration greater than 12g and
                            a peak velocity of 108 km/h.
                            The key to our success is a neural network policy trained with reinforcement learning.
                            Our neural network policy achieved superhuman control performance within minutes of training on
                            a standard workstation. Additinally, our study indicates that the fundamental advantage of
                            reinforcement learning over optimal control is not that
                            it optimizes its objective better but that it optimizes a better objective.
                            RL can directly optimize a task-level objective and can leverage domain randomization
                            to cope with model uncertainty, allowing the discovery of more robust control responses.

                            This project aims to design an optimal controller for agile drone flight. Model
                            Predictive Control (MPC) provides near optimal performance by leveraging models and numerical
                            optimization. However, a key challenge lies in defining an effective loss function with
                            well-tuned hyperparameters, which is task-specific and difficult to search.
                            To address this, we introduce a policy-search-for-model-predictive-control
                            framework that employs policy search to automatically search high-level decision
                            variables for MPC. Specifically, we formulate MPC as a parameterized controller, where
                            traditionally hard-to-optimize decision variables are represented as high-level policies
                            and learned through policy search. This approach enables MPC to adapt to changing environments.

                          Real-world Reinforcement Learning for Inverted Pendulum

                            Back in 2018, reinforcement learning for real-world robotic tasks was still in its infancy.
                            During my master thesis, I developed a model-free reinforcement learning
                            algorithm for the inverted pendulum task. The goal is to train a neural network policy to
                            balance the Furuta pendulum in the real world. The policy is trained using Information-Loss-Bounded
                            Policy Optimization with a reward function that penalizes the distance between the pendulum and
                            the upright position. After training the policy in simulation, we then fine-tuned it in the real world.
                            The policy is able to balance the inverted pendulum in the real world, despite the presence of
                            various disturbances. The Furuta-Pendulum is a rotational inverted pendulum, an
                            under-actuated system invented by Katsuhisa Furuta and colleagues at Tokyo Institute
                            of Technology in 1992. Since then, it has become a standard research platform for
                            demonstrating performance of linear and non-linear control laws.
